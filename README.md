# Scrabble

This is a Scrabble project that I coded in high school with Java GUI. It is a Scrabble game that can be played with one or two players. 
This functions like a regular Scrabble game because it only allows valid tile placement, only allows legal words in the dictictionary, tracks special spots 
(ex. double word score), etc.

I am planning going back and improving this code in the future to make it easier to read and more efficient.

The bulk of my code can be reached by going into the src file and then the Scrabble file. There are also other objects with some code too.
